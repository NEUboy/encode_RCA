# A robustness-improved image encryption scheme utilizing Life-liked cellular automaton
A C++ code for encrypt images

It is strongly recomended to encrypt images with size of 512*512 and 8-bit gray.

Encrypt images please follow these following steps:
1.Put all the original images on the same path with the "main.cpp"
2.Write all the original images' name in the file "fileset.txt", and the program will load the images.
3.Run the code, obtain the test results and encrypted images.
